# UWPocketCasts

A simple UWP client that wraps the [Pocket Casts Beta Player](https://playbeta.pocketcasts.com/web) in a client that responds to media keys.
It was developed and tested in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for [Pocket Casts web player](https://play.pocketcasts.com/). It's relatively inexpensive and great.
1. This was developed in [MS Visual Studio 2017 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), which is recommended for development and deployment.
1. Crack open `UWPocketCasts.sln` in Visual Studio, and hit "> Local Machine" at the top
